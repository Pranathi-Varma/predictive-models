# Predictive Models: Using Linear and Logistic Regression

## Introduction

This report explores the implementation and exploration of linear and logistic regression techniques for developing predictive models. Linear regression models describe the relationship between variables by fitting a line to observed data, while logistic regression determines correlations between two data variables to predict outcomes.

## Methodology

- **Data Import and Cleaning:** Data was imported using Pandas and cleaned to remove inaccurate or incomplete data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Data visualization techniques were employed to summarize primary aspects of the dataset and investigate correlations between variables.
- **Model Descriptions:** Linear and logistic regression models were described and implemented using Python.
- **Experiment and Results:** Models were trained and evaluated, and predictions were made based on the fitted models.

## Experiment and Results

The linear regression model was used to fit a line to the data and predict outcomes. The results were saved in a CSV file.

## Conclusion

Linear regression models are reliable and provide a simple mathematical approach for generating predictions. They have wide applications in various fields, including business and academia. Logistic regression analysis is effective for predicting outcomes with limited outcomes, such as yes or no.
